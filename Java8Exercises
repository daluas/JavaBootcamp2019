1-)Write a method that returns a comma separated string based on a given list of integers. Each element should be preceded by the letter 'e' if the number is even, and preceded by the letter 'o' if the number is odd. For example, if the input list is (3,44), the output should be 'o3,e44'.

2-)The Ceasar cipher is a basic encryption technique used by Julius Ceasar to securely communicate with his generals. Each letter is replaced by another letter N positions down the english alphabet. For example, for a rotation of 5, the letter 'c' would be replaced by an 'h'. In case of a 'z', the alphabet rotates and it is transformed into a 'd'.
Implement a decoder for the Ceasar cipher where N = 5.
TIP: Use code.toCharArray() to get an array of characters.
